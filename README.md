📩 Spam Mail Detection System

📝 Overview

The Spam Mail Detection System is a machine learning model that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where text data undergoes feature extraction and label encoding before training. The system achieves an impressive 96% accuracy on test data.

🏗️ Project Workflow

    Data Preprocessing
        Label encoding is applied to the Category column (Spam → 1, Not Spam → 0).
        Text data is transformed using TF-IDF Vectorization or CountVectorizer for feature extraction.

    Data Splitting
        The dataset is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).
        The train set is used to learn patterns, while the test set evaluates performance.

    Model Training (Logistic Regression)
        A Logistic Regression classifier is trained using the extracted features.
        The model learns to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails.

    Evaluation & Accuracy
        The model achieves 96% accuracy on test data.
        Performance is assessed using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
